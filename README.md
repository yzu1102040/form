# form
Here are some exercises I did
task1: Make a form and submit it in the form of a personal course record. Students are asked to design the appearance themselves.
Task2: Use include or require to create an area calculation form. The form allows the user to input the length and width of the rectangle and then displays the area after sending it.
Task3: Create a form to calculate the inverse matrix of a 2x2 matrix. The task requires using only one file to present the form and calculated results without displaying an error message.
